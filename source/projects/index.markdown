This is my current personal project. It is an app to keep track of money that is
owed. I also plan to add features to track expenditures and income. It is
written in Ruby on Rails. Feel free to visit 
[Bacon Splitter](http://bacon-splitter.herokuapp.com/) and test it out. You can find
the code on github at
